## About the Bangsamoro Scholarship Portal (BSP)

**MoroTech**, as the developer and administrator of the Bangsamoro Scholarship Portal (BSP), does not grant scholarships directly. Instead, the portal serves as a **comprehensive digital ecosystem** for educational opportunities in the Bangsamoro region—combining the functionalities of multiple platforms into one unified experience.

# Design Identity: Green & Gold Theme

The BSP visual identity is derived from the **Bangsamoro Scholars Association** logo, featuring:

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Forest Green** | Represents growth, education, and the Bangsamoro environment |
| **Gold** | Symbolizes excellence, achievement, and prestige |
| **Light Background** | Modern, clean aesthetic for readability and accessibility |

This color scheme reflects the aspirations of Bangsamoro scholars and the region's commitment to educational excellence.

## Portal Model: Three Pillars

The BSP operates on three interconnected pillars that serve its primary users:
